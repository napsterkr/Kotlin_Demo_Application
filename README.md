# Posts
A sample app to demonstrate the building of a good, modular and scalable Android app using Kotlin, Android Architecture Components (LiveData, ViewModel & Room), Dagger, RxJava and RxAndroid among others.

# Features
Some of the features of the app include

- **Effective Networking** - Using a combination of Retrofit, Rx, Room and LiveData, we are able to handle networking in the most effective way.

- **Modular** - The app is broken into modules of features and libraries which can be combined to build instant-apps, complete apps or lite version of apps.

- **MVVM architecture** - Using the lifecycle aware viewmodels, the view observes changes in the model / repository.

- **Kotlin** - This app is completely written in Kotlin.

- **Android Architecture Components** - Lifecycle awareness has been achieved using a combination of LiveData, ViewModels and Room.

 - **Offline first architecture** - All the data is first tried to be loaded from the db and then updated from the server. This ensures that the app is usable even in an offline mode.

 - **Intelligent sync** -Intelligent hybrid syncing logic makes sure your Android app does not make repeated calls to the same back-end API for the same data in a particular time period.

 - **Dependency Injection** - Common elements like `context`, `networking` interface are injected using Dagger 2.

 - **Feature based packaging** - This screen-wise / feature-wise packaging makes code really easy to read and debug.
